# demo program of LSGAN using tensorflow  
This is the demo program of LSGAN using tensorflow.  
It needs input data like Food101 datasets.  

# dependency  
I confirmed operation only with..  
1)python==3.6.0    
2)tensorflow==1.8.0   
3)matplotlib==2.0.0  

# computation graph  


# Prediction  
generated images are below.  
ex1)  Food101/dumplings


ex2)  Food101/sushi  


ex3)  Food101/pho  


ex4)  Food101/paella
